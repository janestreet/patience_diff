(** Bram Cohen's comment from the original Python code (with syntax changed to OCaml):

    [get_matching_blocks a b] returns a list of triples describing matching
    subsequences.

    Each triple is of the form (i, j, n), and means that
    a <|> (i,i+n) = b <|> (j,j+n).  The triples are monotonically increasing in
    i and in j.

    The last triple is a dummy, (Array.length a, Array.length b, 0), and is the only
    triple with n=0.

    Example:
    get_matching_blocks [|"a";"b";"x";"c";"d"|] [|"a";"b";"c";"d"|]
    returns
    [(0, 0, 2), (3, 2, 2), (5, 4, 0)]
*)

  (** Get_matching_blocks not only aggregates the data from [matches a b] but also
      attempts to remove random, semantically meaningless matches ("semantic cleanup").
      The value of [big_enough] governs how aggressively we do so.  See [get_hunks]
      below for more details. *)
  val get_matching_blocks
    :  transform:('a -> elt)
    -> ?big_enough:int
    -> prev:'a array
    -> next:'a array
    -> unit
    -> Matching_block.t list

  (** [matches a b] returns a list of pairs (i,j) such that a.(i) = b.(j) and such that
      the list is strictly increasing in both its first and second coordinates.  This is
      essentially a "unfolded" version of what [get_matching_blocks] returns. Instead of
      grouping the consecutive matching block using [length] this function would return
      all the pairs (prev_start * next_start). *)
  val matches : elt array -> elt array -> (int * int) list

  (** [match_ratio ~compare a b] computes the ratio defined as:

      {[
        2 * len (matches a b) / (len a + len b)
      ]}

      It is an indication of how much alike a and b are.  A ratio closer to 1.0 will
      indicate a number of matches close to the number of elements that can potentially
      match, thus is a sign that a and b are very much alike.  On the next hand, a low
      ratio means very little match. *)
  val match_ratio : elt array -> elt array -> float

  (** [get_hunks ~transform ~context ~prev ~next] will compare the arrays [prev] and
      [next] and produce a list of hunks. (The hunks will contain Same ranges of at most
      [context] elements.)  Negative [context] is equivalent to infinity (producing a
      singleton hunk list).  The value of [big_enough] governs how aggressively we try to
      clean up spurious matches, by restricting our attention to only matches of length
      less than [big_enough].  Thus, setting [big_enough] to a higher value results in
      more aggressive cleanup, and the default value of 1 results in no cleanup at all.
      When this function is called by [Patdiff_core], the value of [big_enough] is 3 at
      the line level, and 7 at the word level. *)
