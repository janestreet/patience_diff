(** In diff terms, a hunk is a unit of consecutive ranges with some [Same] context before
    and after [Next], [Prev], and [Replace] ranges.  Each hunk contains information about
    the original arrays, specifically the starting indexes and the number of elements in
    both arrays to which the hunk refers.

    Furthermore, a diff is essentially a list of hunks.  The simplest case is a diff with
    infinite context, consisting of exactly one hunk. *)
